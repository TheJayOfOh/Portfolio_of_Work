This lab introduced me to creating web-maps with TileMill and MapBox.

For this lab I made 3 maps, the first was simply a map created by working through the tutorial on the TileMill website. The second map I used data I found on police reports in Seattle to experiment with compoistion operations in CartoCSS and styling in general with TileMill. The Third map was to experiment with creating a base map, working with the data files I made from my previous lab on web scraping (also viewable from my Portfolio_of_Work repo).
