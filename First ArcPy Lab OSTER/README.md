#### The first python coding lab for the Geography458 class at the University of Washington

The first goal of the lab was to take a shape file ("saep_bg10") containing all the census blocks of Washington State 
(as well as a database file "WashingtonFIPS.dbf"), and separating out all of each of the census blocks by their county;
putting them into their own unique .shp file named for the county they correspond to. Then the .shp file had to be converted
to a .geojson file.

The second goal of the lab was to calculate the total populations of each county in 2013 using that same shape file ("saep_bg10"), 
and print out a list of the top 10 most populous counties of Washington State in descending order.
