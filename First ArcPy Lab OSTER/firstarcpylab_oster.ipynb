    "This first part took FOREVER AND A HALF. I was working with Andrew Lonie for about 4 or 5 hours on the night of 01-28, and then it took another 3 or 4 hours with much help from you guys (Bergman and Lizotte) as I'm sure you're aware. >_< \n",

    "The hardest parts to figure out were how to add a matching census block row to the new .shp file. At first I tried InsertCursor inserting blank lines then going back with UpdateCursor to update every blank row with the matching row in \"saep_bg10.shp\" because from reading the book it made it sound like InsertCursor only made blank rows.\n",

    "1. Basically I started with a loop to gather up all the unique FIPS values for Washington State. \n",
    "2. Then, I used that loop as a counter for creating the appropriate amount of shape files (later to be .geojson). \n",
    "3. For each run of the master loop:\n",
    "    1. a loop on the WashingtonFIPS.dbf is made to determine the proper county name associated with the FIPS code. \n",
    "    2. After the county name is found a polygon .shp mimicking the schema and spatial ref of the \"saep_bg10.shp\" is made with said county name. \n",
    "    3. Then one last loop through the \"saep_bg10.shp\" file is made to find each row that matches with the current working FIPS code so that it can be added to the county_name.shp file\n",
    "    4. After all the matching rows from the \"saep_bg10.shp\" file are added to the county_name.shp file, the file is finished; but it still needs to be converted to a .geojson, so that is accomplished right before the master loops moves on to the next unique FIPS code"
