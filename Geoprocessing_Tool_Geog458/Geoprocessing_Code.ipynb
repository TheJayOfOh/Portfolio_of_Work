    "### Goals of this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.\n",
    "   Develop flexible code that lets the user reclassify an attribute within a vector feature class according to flexible criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. \n",
    "   Package the code up into a Geoprocessing tool that can be used within ArcGIS Desktop's GUI, within ModelBuilder, or in ArcPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. \n",
    "   Experiment with new ways of putting the tool I develop out onto the internet as a service that could be used by other people on other computers from afar without downloading or installing the code locally."

    "#### Goal 1:\n",
    "- Assume the user gives you a valid shapefile (_mytable_)\n",
    "- Have the user specify that s/he wants to reclassify a specific field (_infield_)\n",
    "- store the results of the reclassify in a new field by a name the user specifies (_outfield_)\n",
    "- Take a user provided table (_reclasstable_) that tells you how to do the reclassification. Specifically, the table has columns named _lowerbound_, _upperbound_, and _value_.\n",
    "- For every row in _mytable_, have the code look at the value of _infield_ and decide what to write in the _outfield_...\n",
    "    To do this: \n",
    "    1. go throuh the _reclasstable_ to find the first row in _reclasstable_ where the value from _infield_ is greater than or equal to the _lowerbound_ and less-than-or-equal-to the _upperbound_\n",
    "    2. if this row exists: then _outfield_ should be set to _value_\n",
    "    3. if no row in the _reclasstable_ matches the current value in _infield_, then _outfield_ should be set to a special number called _notfoundvalue_, which the user has also specified."
